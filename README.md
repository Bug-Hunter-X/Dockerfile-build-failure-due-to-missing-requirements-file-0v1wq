This repository contains a Dockerfile that fails to build due to a missing requirements.txt file. The original Dockerfile is named `Dockerfile`, and the corrected version is named `Dockerfile.fixed`.  The error arises from an incorrect assumption about the location of the requirements file or a missing file altogether.  The solution involves ensuring the requirements file is present in the context of the Docker build process and that the path in the Dockerfile is correctly referencing it.
